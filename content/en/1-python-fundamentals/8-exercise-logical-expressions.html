<h1>Exercise: Logical expressions</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you'll define functions to return Boolean expressions based on input parameters. Before you start coding, remember to check the doctests for examples of what should return <code>True</code>/<code>False</code>. When you think you're done coding, run the tests to make sure they all pass.</p>
<p>🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  If you have any questions while working through the exercises, just post in the #exercises channel on Slack. For example, you can post "I'm looking for help with the Curly Hair Checker exercise." and then post your code in the thread (so as to not reveal the answer for those who haven't worked on it yet). Please do post when you have questions, we're here to help!</p>
