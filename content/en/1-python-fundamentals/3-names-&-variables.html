<h1>Names & variables</h1>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>We very often want to re-use the same values multiple times in the same computer program - just imagine if we were writing a geometry program and needed to write the value of œÄ to 50 digits every time we used it in a calculation!</p>
<p>To re-use a value, we just need to give it a <bold>name</bold>. Then, whenever we want to reference that value, we just reference the name instead.</p>
<p>One way to assign a name in Python is with an assignment statement. This statement assigns the name <code>x</code> to the value 7.</p>
<pre><code>x = 7</code></pre>
<p>The value could be any Python value, or it could even be an expression.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 // 5</code></pre>
<p>A name that holds a piece of data is also known as a <bold>variable</bold>.</p>
<h3>Using variables</h3>
<p>The great thing about variables is that once they exist, we can reference them multiple times in our code!</p>
<p>Here's a short program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle:</p>
<pre><code>pi = 3.1415926535
radius = 6
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
circ = 2 * pi * radius</code></pre>

<p>Here's another program to do some string concatenation. And yes, it's a true story.</p>
<pre><code>my_last_name = 'Fox'
partners_last_name = 'Gray'
daughters_last_name = partners_last_name + my_last_name</code></pre>
<p>TODO: Quiz</p>
<h3>Re-assignment</h3>
<p>A name can only be bound to a single value.</p>
<p>What do you think the following Python code will do?</p>
<pre><code>my_name = 'Pamela'

my_name = my_name + 'ela'</code></pre>
<p>TODO: Quiz</p>
<p>In Python, re-assigning a name to a new value will replace the old value. However, Python evaluates the right-hand side of an assignment statement <italic>before</italic> the left-hand side, so when the right-hand side references the name, it will retrieve its current value, and then <italic>only once it's done</italic> computing the right-hand expression, it will re-assign the variable to the value of that expression.</p>
<h3>Augmented assignment operators</h3>
<p>It's actually incredibly common to re-assign a variable based on its previous contents, so common that Python and many other languages provide special operators to make it easier.</p>
<p>For example, instead of:</p>
<pre><code>my_name = my_name + 'ela'</code></pre>
<p>I could simply write:</p>
<pre><code>my_name += 'ela'</code></pre>
<p>That <code>+=</code> operator means "take the previous value and add this new value to it".</p>
<p>This table summarizes all the special operators like that one:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-sm">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Long version</p>
<th>
<p>Shortcut</p>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>x = x + 1</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>x += 1</code></p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>y = y - 1</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>y -= 1</code></p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>r = r * 2</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>r *= 2</code></p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>w = w / 3</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>w /= 3</code></p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>a = a // 4</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>a //= 4</code></p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>p = p ** 2</code></p>
<td>
<p><code>p **= 2</code></p>
</table>
<h3>Naming rules</h3>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when coming up with names for your variables:</p>
<ul><li><p>A name must be typed exactly the way it was originally typed. Names are case sensitive (<code>my_hobby</code> is a different name than <code>MY_HOBBY</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>A good name is both descriptive but not overly descriptive. <code>my_hobby</code> is clear and descriptive, <code>mh</code> is too short and mysterious, and <code>my_most_favorite_hobby_ever</code> is overly verbose.</p></li>
<li><p>When a name is made up of multiple words, the Python convention is to separate each word with an underscore.</p></li>
<li><p>A name may contain numbers, but it <italic>cannot</italic> start with a number. It can either start with a letter or an underscore, but starting with an underscore actually has a special meaning we'll get into later.</p></li></ul>
