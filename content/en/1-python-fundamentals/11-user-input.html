<h1>User input</h1>
<p>Many programs need a way to accept user input. In fact, one of my favorite parts of coding is making a program that accepts user input and then seeing what users pass into the program. You never know what users will say!</p>
<p>Python provides a built-in function for accepting input in command-line programs: <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>input</code> function takes a single optional argument, and displays that as the prompt. Here's what that looks like when used inside the Python console:</p>
<p><img src="https://corise.com/static/course/python-crash-course/assets/cl111kuo4019m116g7kyq25sr/input_commandline.gif">Once the user answer the prompts, the function returns the user's answer. The following code prompts a user and saves the answer into a variable:</p>
<pre><code>answer = input('How are you? ')</code></pre>
<p>We could then use that answer in future expressions, as the input to function calls, inside a Boolean expression, etc.</p>
<p>Play around with the <code>input</code> examples below. Notice that this editor pops up a prompt in the browser, so the interface for this is different than running the same code in a local Python console.</p>
<pre><code>feeling = input('And how are you today?')
print('I am also feeling ' + feeling)

ice_cream = input('Whats your fav ice cream?')
print('Mmmm, ' + ice_cream + ' on a hot day sounds so good!')</code></pre>


<h3>Converting strings to numbers</h3>
<p>The <code>input</code> function always returns the user input as a string. That’s all well and good if that’s what your code is expecting, but what if you are asking them a question with a numerical answer?</p>
<p>To convert a string to an integer, wrap it in <code>int()</code> and Python will attempt to construct an integer based on the string. For example:</p>
<pre><code>int("33")  # 33
int("0")   # 0</code></pre>
<p>You can’t pass a string that looks like a floating point number to <code>int()</code> however. In that case, you need to use <code>float()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>float('33.33')
float('33.0')
float('33')</code></pre>
<p>If you’re not sure whether a user’s input is going to include a decimal point, the safest approach is to use <code>float()</code>. </p>
<p>If you want to remove the digits after the decimal afterwards, you can then use either <code>int()</code>, <code>round()</code>, <code>floor()</code>, or <code>ceil()</code>.</p>
<p>Play around with the example below; try giving floating point answers and see what happens. </p>
<pre><code>from math import floor, ceil

answer = input('How old is the toddler?')
age = float(answer)

print('They are exactly ', age)
print('They are approx ', round(age))
print('They are older than ', floor(age))
print('They are no older than ', ceil(age))</code></pre>
