<h1>Preparing for the Course</h1>
We created co:rise for professionals looking to acquire new skills. This course is a "flipped classroom" model, and it moves quickly. To make the most of your co:rise experience, we recommend three key tips:

**(1) Block out enough time each week** <br>
Tactically, anticipate that co:rise will require a commitment of time and energy. Block out at least 5-7 hours on your calendar each week during your course. If you're coming in with no programming experience, you will likely need to block out more than that.

The live sessions are meant to complement the online course materials; this is NOT the type of course where you can show up to live sessions and learn everything you need to complete the coding exercises and projects. 

**(2) Ask questions when you are stuck** 
<br> We have a "all questions are good questions" philosophy at co:rise. Reach out if you are having an issue and ask a question in Slack! Others will benefit from learning alongside you.

**(3) Do as much of the weekly project as possible and submit what you have** 
<br> We have designed the course to be at the intersection of challenge and ability, which means some of the material will be difficult! Don't worry if you're having trouble completing the  weekly project -- just do as much as you can, and submit what you have. We care that you are learning and building your skillset, not that your weekly project is completely polished. When you submit your project you can indicate where you got stuck/need help and your peer reviewer will support you. 

Your experience going through course materials will depend on your prior experience and your learning style, but below is a potential guide to help manage your time:
- **Monday:** 1hr Live lecture 
- **Monday-Wednesday** Go through the articles and coding exercises, completing as many as you can and asking any questions in Slack. You will likely need to allocate about an hour each day, or more if you're new to programming.
- **Wednesday/Thursday:** 1hr project session: start going through the project with course team and classmates. 
- **Friday/Saturday:** Coding parties: Twice a week, your TA will host sessions for you to work on you weekly project with the support of peers and the TA if needed.
- **Sunday:** Submit your project by end of day Sunday, and then complete code/peer review by end of day Monday. You can review other project submissions in the #projects channel for inspiration and learning.
