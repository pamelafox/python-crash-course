<h1>For loops & ranges</h1>
<p>Now we'll learn a more specialized loop: <bold>the </bold><code>for</code> loop. The uses of a <code>for</code> loop vary by language, but in Python, a <code>for</code> loop is useful whenever we want to iterate through a sequence, like iterating through a range of numbers or through a list of items.</p>
<p>Here's the general template of a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>for <value> in <sequence>:
    <statement>
    <statement></code></pre>
<p>The loop below iterates through a sequence of numbers, printing their multiples of 9. Try it!</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(1, 5):
    print(9 * num)</code></pre>
<p>Writing that same program with a <code>while</code> loop would require additional lines of code :</p>
<pre><code>num = 1
while num < 5:
    print(9 * num)
    num += 1</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a <code>for</code> loop can be a much more concise way of writing a loop than a <code>while</code> loop. When it's possible to use a <code>for</code> loop, it's generally the preferred way, and <code>while</code> loops can be reserved for more exotic computations.</p>
<p>Now let's dig into how <code>range()</code> works.</p>
<h3>Ranges</h3>
<p>The example above iterated through the numbers 1 through 4 by calling <code>range()</code>, a function that constructs a sequence of numbers. The <code>range()</code> function can be called with a varying number of arguments, and behaves differently depending on how many arguments it's called with.</p>
<p>If <code>range()</code> is called with just one argument, then the range starts at 0 and ends <italic>just before</italic> the given value.</p>
<p>For example, this code prints the numbers 0 through 5 (<italic>not</italic> including 6):</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(6):
    print(num)</code></pre>
<p>If <code>range()</code> is called with two arguments, then the range starts at the first value and ends just before the second value.</p>
<p>For example, this code prints the numbers 1 through 5:</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, if <code>range()</code> is called with three arguments, then the range will increment according to the third value.</p>
<p>The example below prints the numbers 1, 3, and 5, since the range increments by 2 instead of 1 (the default):</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(num)</code></pre>
