<h1>Looping through sequences</h1>
<p>A <bold>sequence</bold> is any type of data that has sequential data inside it. A list is considered a sequence since it contains items in a sequence. A string is also considered a sequence since it contains characters in a sequence. The Python language also offers other sequential data types like tuples and sets, but we won't be diving into those in this course.</p>
<p>All sequence types can be looped through using a loop, either a <code>while</code> loop or <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<h3>While loops with lists</h3>
<p>It's very common to use a loop to process the items in a list, doing some sort of computation on each item.</p>
<p>For example, this <code>while</code> loop compares the counter variable <code>i</code> to the list length, and also uses that counter variable <code>i</code> as the current index:</p>
<pre><code>scores = [80, 95, 78, 92]
total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(scores):
    score = scores[i]
    total += score
    i += 1</code></pre>
<p>That loop sums up all the numbers in a list, storing the result in <code>total</code>, and stopping after it accesses the last element. Remember, the index of the last element is <code>len(list) - 1)</code>, <italic>not</italic> <code>len(list)</code>. That's why the comparison operator in the loop condition is <code><</code> and not <code><=</code>. Accidentally using <code><=</code> instead will lead to the dreaded off-by-one error. 🙀(At this point, you might be beginning to see why off-by-one errors are so common in programming.)</p>
<aside><p>You might have noticed that I used <code>i</code> instead of <code>counter</code> in that code, as that's the standard naming convention when iterating through loops. These days, we often pretend that <code>i</code> stands for "index". However, it originally came about because the Fortran language manual started off only using the letters i - q for integer variable names, and Fortran probably chose that range due to common mathematics notation.</p></aside>
<h3>For loops with lists</h3>
<p>There's a much simpler way to iterate through a list: the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code>scores = [80, 95, 78, 92]
total = 0
for score in scores:
    total += score</code></pre>
<p>No counter variable, loop condition, or bracket notation needed! Python will start from the beginning of the list and put the current item in the <code>score</code> loop variable in each iteration, so your loop body can just reference <code>score</code>.</p>
<h3>Looping through strings</h3>
<p>Since a string is also a sequential data type, we can also use loops to iterate through a string. Looping over strings is less common than looping over lists, however.</p>
<p>The following loop prints out an integer representing the Unicode code point of each letter in a string:</p>
<pre><code>letters = "ABC"
for letter in letters:
    print(ord(letter))</code></pre>
<p>If we iterate through a string with characters that require multiple code points, there will be an iteration for each of those code points.</p>
<pre><code>emoji = "🤷🏽‍♀️"
for code_point in emoji:
    print(ord(code_point))</code></pre>
<p>How many numbers do you think that will print out? Try it and see!</p>
<pre><code># Try some code here</code></pre>
