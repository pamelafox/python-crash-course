<h1>Exercise: Nested lists</h1>
<p>Try out iterating through nested lists and computing different things in the exercises below. These are a great practice for this week's project, as it will involve a lot of nested lists.</p>
<p>🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  If you have any questions while working through the exercises, just post in the #exercises channel on Slack. For example, you can post "I'm looking for help with the Sum Grid exercise." and then post your code in the thread (so as to not reveal the answer for those who haven't worked on it yet). Please post when you have questions, we're here to help!</p>
<h3>Sum Grid</h3>
<p>Implement <code>sum_grid</code>, a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in <code>grid</code>, a 2-dimensional list of numbers.</p>
<p>📺 Need help getting started? Here's <link>a video walkthrough</link> of a similar problem.</p>
<pre><code>def sum_grid(grid):
    """Returns the sum of all the numbers in the given grid, a 2-D list of numbers.

    >>> grid1 = [
    ...     [5, 1, 6],   # 12
    ...     [10, 4, 1],  # 15
    ...     [8, 3, 2]    # 13
    ... ]
    >>> sum_grid(grid1)
    40
    >>> grid2 = [
    ...     [15, 1, 6], # 22
    ...     [10, 4, 0], # 14
    ...     [8, 3, 2]   # 13
    ... ]
    >>> sum_grid(grid2)
    49
    """
    # Initialize a sum to 0
    # Iterate through the grid
    # Iterate through current row
    # Add current value to sum
    # Return sum</code></pre>

<h3>Contains 15 row?</h3>
<p>Implement <code>contains_15row</code>, a function that returns true if any of the rows in <code>grid</code>, a 2-dimension list of numbers, add up to a total of 15.</p>
<pre><code>def contains_15row(grid):
    """Takes an input of a 2-dimensional list of numbers
        and returns true if any of the rows add up to 15.
    
    >>> grid1 = [
    ...     [5, 1, 6],   # 12
    ...     [10, 4, 1],  # 15!!
    ...     [8, 3, 2]    # 13
    ... ]
    >>> contains_15row(grid1)
    True
    >>> grid2 = [
    ...     [15, 1, 6], # 22
    ...     [10, 4, 0], # 14
    ...     [8, 3, 2]   # 13
    ... ]
    >>> contains_15row(grid2)
    False
    """
    # Iterate through the grid
    # Initialize a sum to 0
    # Iterate through the row
    # Add current value to sum
    # If sum is 15, return true
    # return false otherwise</code></pre>
