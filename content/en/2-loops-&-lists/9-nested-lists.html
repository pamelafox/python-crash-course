<h1>Nested lists</h1>
<p>A Python list can contain any value, so in fact, the items can themselves be lists. When a list is made up of other lists, we call it a <bold>nested list</bold>.</p>
<p>Here's a nested list representing the names and scores of three gymnasts:</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts = [
             ["Brittany", 9.15, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2],
             ["Lea", 9, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5],
             ["Maya", 9.2, 8.7, 9.2, 8.8]
           ]</code></pre>
<p>We can treat this like any other list, using bracket notation and list methods to interact with the list.</p>
<p>TODO: Quiz</p>

<h3>Accessing nested list items</h3>
<p>Starting again with this nested list:</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts = [
                ["Brittany", 9.15, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2],
                ["Lea", 9, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5],
                ["Maya", 9.2, 8.7, 9.2, 8.8]
            ]</code></pre>
<p>To access each of the three lists in <code>gymnasts</code>, we use the same bracket notation from before:</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts[0]     # ["Brittany", 9.15, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
gymnasts[1]     # ["Lea", 9, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5],
gymnasts[2]     # ["Maya", 9.2, 8.7, 9.2, 8.8]</code></pre>
<p>We can also reach deep into the nested list and access items inside the inner lists, however. We just add another level of bracket notation!</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts[0][0]  # "Brittany"
gymnasts[1][0]  # "Lea"
gymnasts[1][4]  # 9.5
gymnasts[1][5]  # 🚫 IndexError!
gymnasts[3][0]  # 🚫 IndexError!</code></pre>
<p>TODO: Quiz</p>
<h3>Modifying nested lists</h3>
<p>We can replace the inner lists inside a nested list using bracket notation.</p>
<p>This code replaces the entire first list with a brand new list:</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts[0] = ["Olivia", 8.75, 9.1, 9.6, 9.8]</code></pre>
<p>We can also modify items inside nested lists, using either bracket notation or list methods.</p>
<pre><code>gymnasts[1][0] = "Leah"
gymnasts[2][4] = 9.8
gymnasts[2].append(10.5)</code></pre>
<p>None of this is new functionality; this is the same functionality you learnt from before. It all just works as a consequence of Python allowing lists to contain other lists. I like to explicitly point it out, however, since it's not always immediately obvious, and nested lists are such a powerful data structure in programming.</p>
<h3>Looping through nested lists</h3>
<p>To iterate through every item in a nested list, we can use a <bold>nested for loop</bold>: a <code>for</code> loop inside a <code>for</code> loop!</p>
<p>Starting from this nested list of just the numeric scores:</p>
<pre><code>team_scores = [
                [9.15, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2],
                [9, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5],
                [9.2, 8.7, 9.2, 8.8]
              ]</code></pre>
<p>We can sum them up using this nested <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>sum_scores = 0
for member_scores in team_scores:
    for score in member_scores:
        sum_scores += score</code></pre>
<p>The trickiest thing with nested loops is keeping track of what each loop variable represents. In the above code, <code>member_scores</code> stores each of the inner lists in each iteration- first <code>[9.15, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]</code>, then <code>[9, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5]</code>, finally <code>[9.2, 8.7, 9.2, 8.8]</code>. Then in the inner loop, <code>score</code> stores each of the numbers inside those lists, starting with 9.15 and ending with 8.8. </p>
<p>If you're ever not sure what your variable is storing, you can always print it out and double check.</p>
