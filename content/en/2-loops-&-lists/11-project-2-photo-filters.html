<h1>Project 2: Photo Filters</h1>
<p>In this project, you'll be applying filters to photos, like inversion, flipping, and grayscale- and you'll be writing all those filters yourself!</p>
<p>A photo can be represented in computer memory as a nested list of pixels, so playing with photos is a great way to practice your newfound list knowledge. And, of course, in order to process a nested list, you'll need nested loops, so photo filters involve lots of nested loops. You'll also learn a bit about representing pixels in the RGB color space, if you've never played with RGB before.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I love playing with graphics when I'm programming is that even the bugs are fun - weird colors, all black images, all sorts of shenanigans. So get ready for some colorful bugs and a lot of learning! :)</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Once again, you'll be using a Python notebook on Google CoLab to develop this project.</p>
<p>To get started, make a copy of the <link>Project 2 notebook</link> for yourself. The rest of the instructions are in the notebook.</p>
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>We want all of you to be able to complete this project. Before you get started on it, make sure you've completed the Week 2 exercises, since the project depends on those fundamental skills. To get help when working through this project:</p>
<ul><li><p>Join us in the live project session.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions in the Slack #questions channel. 🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  </p></li>
<li><p>Attend the TA's coding parties and ask questions. Check the calendar for days/times.</p></li></ul>
