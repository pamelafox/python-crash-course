<h1>String operations</h1>
<p>In Python, both lists and strings are considered types of sequences. That means that many of the operations that work on lists also work on strings.</p>
<p>The <code>len()</code> function reports how long a string is (which is, in the example below, the length of the longest English word ever!):</p>
<pre><code>illness = 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'
longest_word_record_length = len(illness)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>in</code> operator checks to see if a substring is inside a larger string:</p>
<pre><code>if 'pneumo' in illness:
  print("Uh oh, your poor lungs :(")</code></pre>
<p>When used on strings, a <code>for</code> loop iterates through each character:</p>
<pre><code>alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for letter in alphabet:
    print(letter)</code></pre>
<h3>Bracket notation</h3>
<p>We can use bracket notation to access single characters inside a string:</p>
<pre><code>illness = 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'

true_start_sound = illness[1]   # Stores 'n'
last_letter = illness[-1]       # Stores 's'</code></pre>
<p>However, strings are different from lists in that they are <bold>immutable</bold>, meaning they cannot be changed after they're created. Using bracket notation to try to change a character will result in an error.</p>
<pre><code>illness[0] = "n"   # üö´ Error!</code></pre>
<p>We can also use bracket notation to slice parts of the string, from a start to (just before) an end index:</p>
<pre><code>how_small = illness[13:24]      # Stores 'microscopic'
from_where = illness[30:37]     # Stores 'volcano'</code></pre>
<h3>Exercise: Bracket notation</h3>
<p>Use this string variable for the next three questions:</p>
<pre><code>author_name = 'P S Fox'</code></pre>

<h3>String methods</h3>
<p>Python offers many methods for string-specific functionality. Since strings are immutable, however, <italic>none</italic> of the methods change the original string. They either return a new string entirely, or return some other result like a boolean, number, or a list.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>upper()</code> method returns an uppercase version of a string.</p>
<pre><code>request = "Please wash the dishes from your cookie disaster."
demand = request.upper()</code></pre>
<p>When that code runs, <code>request</code> is still "Please wash the dishes from your cookie disaster." but <code>demand</code> stores "PLEASE WASH THE DISHES FROM YOUR COOKIE DISASTER." (Code based on a true story, but I was the one who caused the disaster.. üç™)</p>
<p>Here are some of the most helpful string methods:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-sm">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Method</p>
<th>
<p>Description</p>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>lower()</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns a copy of the string with all characters converted to lowercase.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>replace(old, new)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns a new string where occurrences of old are replaced with new.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>find(substring)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns the lowest index in the string where substring is found.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>startswith(prefix)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns True if the string starts with the prefix, and False otherwise.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>endswith(suffix)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns True if the strings ends with the suffix, and False otherwise.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>strip([chars])</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing characters removed, defaulting to whitespace characters.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>split(separator)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns a list of substrings in the string, using separator as the delimiter.</p>
<tr>
<td>
<p><code>join(iterable)</code></p>
<td>
<p>Returns a string which is the concatenation of strings in the iterable object.</p>
</table>
<p>More methods are described in the <link>Python documentation</link>.</p>
<p>Remember that these are methods, not functions, so when using them, you always write the variable name first, then the dot, then the method name.</p>
<p>TODO: Quiz</p>
<h3>Splitting and joining</h3>
<p>There are two string methods that I want to spend more time on, because they're just so dang useful, but can also be a little tricky to use: <code>split</code> and <code>join</code>.</p>
<ul><li><p><code>split(separator)</code>: Returns a list of substrings in the string, using separator as the delimiter.</p></li>
<li><p><code>join(iterable)</code>: Returns a string which is the concatenation of strings in the iterable object.</p></li></ul>
<p>The <code>split</code> method is handy whenever you have a string of text with parts separated by a particular character, like a comma, colon, pipe, space, or tab.</p>
<p>For example, we can split a string that stores a comma-separated list of words:</p>
<pre><code>my_groceries = 'apples,bananas,carrots'
grocery_items = my_groceries.split(',')   # Stores ["apples", "bananas", "carrots"]</code></pre>
<p>Now we can iterate through that list - or anything else we can usually do with a list.</p>
<pre><code>for item in grocery_items:
    print(item)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>join</code> method is the opposite: it joins a list of items into a single string, separating each item with the specified separator.</p>
<p>Here's how we can join together a list using a comma as the separator:</p>
<pre><code>address_parts = ["123 Pining St", "Nibbsville", "OH"]
",".join(address_parts) # '123 Pining St, Nibbsville, OH'</code></pre>
<p>We can also use the empty string as the separator, if we just want to mash strings together:</p>
<pre><code>names = ["Gray", "Fox"]
"".join(names)   # 'GrayFox'</code></pre>
<h3>Exercise: Write a poem</h3>
<p>In order to create a string with items separated by new lines, we can specify the escape sequence "\n" as the separator.</p>
<p>Try it out below with your own favorite poem, haiku, or song verse.</p>
<pre><code>poem_lines = ["Forgive me", "they were delicious", "so sweet", "and so cold"]
"\n".join(poem_lines)</code></pre>
