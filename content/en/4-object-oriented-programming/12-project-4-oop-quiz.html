<h1>Project 4: OOP Quiz</h1>
<p>For this project, you're going to use object-oriented programming to write a quiz that can handle different kinds of questions - and you'll use it to deliver a quiz on a topic of your choosing.</p>
<p>The code for this project is inspired by many codebases that I've worked on myself: Khan Academy's exercises, Coursera's timed quizzes, Berkeley's online CS exams. All of them have used a slightly different class design, but they've all used the power of OOP to describe the structure of quizzes and the questions inside them.</p>
<p>I look forward to trying out all of your quizzes!</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>You'll be using a Python notebook on Google CoLab to develop this project.</p>
<p>To get started, make a copy of the <link>Project 4 notebook</link> for yourself. The rest of the instructions are in the notebook.</p>
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>We want all of you to be able to complete this project. Before you get started on it, make sure you've completed the Week 4 exercises, since the project depends on those fundamental skills. To get help when working through this project:</p>
<ul><li><p>Join us in the live project session.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions in Slack. 🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  </p></li>
<li><p>Attend the TA's coding parties and ask questions. Check the calendar for days/times.</p></li></ul>
