<h1>Exercise: More on classes</h1>
<p>These exercises will give you practice with class variables and class methods.</p>
<p>🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  If you have any questions while working through the exercises, just post in the #exercises channel on Slack. For example, you can post "I'm looking for help with the StudentGrade exercise." and then post your code in the thread (so as to not reveal the answer for those who haven't worked on it yet). Please post when you have questions, we're here to help!</p>
<h2>Missing class variables</h2>
<p>In the first two exercises, the class definitions are missing a class variable. Read the docstring and doctests to determine the name and value of the missing class variable, add it in, and run the doctests after.</p>
<h3>Exercise: StudentGrade</h3>
<p>📺 Need help with this one? Watch the <link>video walkthrough</link> of the solution. Then try it out yourself and apply what you learned to the next exercise.</p>
<pre><code>class StudentGrade:
  """Represents the grade for a student in a class
  and indicates when a grade is failing.
  For all students, 159 points is considered a failing grade.

  >>> grade1 = StudentGrade("Arfur Artery", 300)
  >>> grade1.is_failing()
  False
  >>> grade2 = StudentGrade("MoMo OhNo", 158)
  >>> grade2.is_failing()
  True
  >>> grade1.failing_grade
  159
  >>> grade2.failing_grade
  159
  >>> StudentGrade.failing_grade
  159
  >>>
  """
  
  def __init__(self, student_name, num_points):
    self.student_name = student_name
    self.num_points = num_points

  def is_failing(self):
    return self.num_points < StudentGrade.failing_grade</code></pre>

<h3>Exercise: Article</h3>
<pre><code>class Article:
  """Represents an article on an educational website.
  The license for all articles should be "CC-BY-NC-SA".

  >>> article1 = Article("Logic", "Samuel Tarín")
  >>> article1.get_byline()
  'By Samuel Tarín, License: CC-BY-NC-SA'
  >>> article2 = Article("Loops", "Pamela Fox")
  >>> article2.get_byline()

    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  def get_byline(self):
    return f"By {self.author}, License: {self.license}"</code></pre>

<h2>Class methods</h2>
<h3>Exercise: Thneed Factory</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you'll finish the implementation of <code>make_thneed</code>, a class method that can make Thneeds of a given size and a random color.</p>
<p><bold>Hint: </bold>You can use<bold> </bold><code>random.choice(list)</code> to generate a random color from a list of colors.</p>
<p>📺 Need help with this one? Watch the <link>video walkthrough</link> <link>o</link>f the solution. Then try it out yourself and apply what you learned to the next exercise.</p>
<pre><code>import random

class Thneed:
    def __init__(self, color, size):
        self.color = color
        self.size = size

    @classmethod
    def make_thneed(cls, size):
        """
        Returns a new instance of a Thneed with
        a random color and the given size.
        >>> rand_thneed = Thneed.make_thneed("small")
        >>> isinstance(rand_thneed, Thneed)

        """
        # YOUR CODE HERE</code></pre>
<h3>Exercise: Cat adoption</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you'll finish the implementation of <code>adopt_random_cat</code>, a class method that can generate new cats. Just what we need in the world! 🐈‍⬛🐈</p>
<p><bold>Hint: </bold>You can use<bold> </bold><code>random.choice(list)</code> to generate a random name from a list of names and <code>random.randrange(start, stop)</code> to generate a random number of lives.</p>
<pre><code>import random

class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
        self.lives = lives

    @classmethod
    def adopt_random_cat(cls, owner):
        """
        Returns a new instance of a Cat with the given owner,
        a randomly chosen name and a random number of lives.
        >>> randcat = Cat.adopt_random_cat("Ifeoma")
        >>> isinstance(randcat, Cat)
