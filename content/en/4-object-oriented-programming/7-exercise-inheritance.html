<h1>Exercise: Inheritance</h1>
<p>These exercises are all about overriding base classes. In the first two exercises, you'll override just the class variables. In the last two, you'll also override methods.</p>
<p>üôãüèΩ üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üôãüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  If you have any questions while working through the exercises, just post in the #exercises channel on Slack. For example, you can post "I'm looking for help with the Weighty Dog exercise." and then post your code in the thread (so as to not reveal the answer for those who haven't worked on it yet). Please post when you have questions, we're here to help!</p>
<h3>Exercise: Animal Subclasses</h3>
<p>Finish the two subclasses <code>Sloth</code> and <code>Cat</code> so that they both inherit from <code>Animal</code> and override class variables according to the values in their doctests.</p>
<p>üì∫ Need help with this one? Watch this <link>video walkthrough</link> of a partial solution. Then try it out yourself and apply what you learned to the next exercise.</p>
<pre><code>class Animal:

<h3>Exercise: LearnableContent subclasses</h3>
<p>The <code>LearnableContent</code> class below is based on an actual class from the Khan Academy Python codebase. Finish the implementation of the <code>Article</code> and <code>Video</code> subclasses to properly inherit from <code>LearnableContent</code> and override class variables according to the values in the doctests.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Boss methods</h3>
<p>The <code>Character</code> class below represents a character in a video game. Finish implementing the methods in <code>Boss</code> so that they override the base class methods and behave according to the comments and doctests.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Clothing methods</h3>
<p>The <code>Clothing</code> class below represents pieces of clothing in a closet, and <code>KidsClothing</code> inherits from it. Write a <code>clean</code> method that overrides the base class method according to the comment and the doctests.</p>
