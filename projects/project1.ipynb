You could even use default arguments in your `calculate_score` function if that makes the code cleaner.\n",

You can do some error checking after receiving each answer to make sure it is compatible with what `calculate_score` expects, and if not, you can try to convert it into an appropriate response or ask the user a follow-up question to clarify.\n",

They ask a bunch of questions and then declare which character you're the most like. You can use a very similar approach to this project to make a quiz like that. That'd be pretty different from the original project though, so make a copy of your original notebook if you go down that path!"
